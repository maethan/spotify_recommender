1. Spotify Recommender is a app that gives users song recommendations based on genres that they pick. Users can input up to 5 genres from the dropdown list, edit choices using the live list of user-selected choices, submit for recommendations, and then finally view the album cover, song name, and artist for each recommendation.

2. For frontend, I chose to include components and mobile responsiveness, and for backend I made multiple API calls. For full-stack I linked together React with Node and finally also deployed the site using heroku.

3. For just developing this project, I took about 5 hours. Including design (1 hour) and learning (2 hours) this project was a total of about ~8 hours.
